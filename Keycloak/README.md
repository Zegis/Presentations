# Keycloak introduction

Short presentation around the keycloak basics, made for Lunch And Learn at work, along with .net core 3.1 and vue 3 demos.

Demos can be found in [separate repository](https://github.com/Zegis/Presentations_demos/tree/main/Keycloak).

Vue 3 is using the keycloak 4.8.3 adapter to better reflect what we're dealing with at work.


Please take note that slides are mostly keywords around the concepts I was talking about.
